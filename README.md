# 🚀Intelligent Version Control System

It is a lightweight, AI-enhanced Version Control System designed to simplify code tracking, visualization, and recovery. It combines core version control capabilities with intelligent automation and interactive visual tools to improve developer productivity.

---

## 📌 Overview

Traditional version control systems rely heavily on command-line logs and manual commit management. This enhances this experience by introducing:

- 🤖 AI-powered commit intelligence
- 🌳 Interactive visual commit graph
- ⏳ Smart time-travel recovery system

Our goal is to make version control smarter, more intuitive, and easier to understand — especially for students and developers.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1️⃣ AI Commit Intelligence
Automatically analyzes file changes and generates meaningful, structured commit messages.

**Capabilities:**
- Detects type of change (feature, bug fix, refactor, documentation)
- Generates semantic commit messages
- Summarizes multi-file updates
- Encourages standardized commit formatting

---

### 2️⃣ Interactive Visual Commit Graph
A dynamic graphical representation of branches and commit history.

**Capabilities:**
- Visual branch and merge tracking
- Clickable commit nodes
- Hover-based metadata preview
- Color-coded branch visualization
- Zoomable timeline navigation

This makes project evolution easy to understand at a glance.
